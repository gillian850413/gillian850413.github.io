This analysis focused on wealth distribution, wealth differences, gdp among billionaires and citizens in different regions. </p><h2>Number of Billionaires in each country</h2><p>The diagram shows the billionaire distribution of each country in 1996, 2011 and 2014. The blue part (2014) demonstrates the largest proportion of the billionaire distribution. On top, the United States is the country with the largest number of billionaire.</p><div class=""></div><h2>Comparison of average worth in billions of individual billionaire among seven regions</h2><p>Each bar represents the aggregated net worth of each billionaire within each region in 1996, 2001, and 2014. From the plot, we can see that the average net worth is between 2 billion and 4 billion, and there are not much difference among the regions.</p><div class=""></div><h2>GDP and Proportion trend</h2><p>The above charts show us the seven regionsâ€™ GDP in 1996, 2001 and 2014, while the charts in the bottom display the proportion that numbers of billionaires hold in the population of these seven regions. We can see from the charts that there is a clear positive correlation between GDP trend and billionaire proportion trend in each of the seven regions, and a strong relation between GDP value and proportion value at any certain time.</p><div class=""></div><div class=""></div><h2>The gaps between the haves and have-nots</h2><p>From the dataset we collected, we have the number of billionaires and their total amount of property in each country, along with GDP value and population of these countries. We assume we can develop an indicator that can to some extent quantify the gap between the haves and have-nots based on these data. Here is the equation of our indicator:</p><img src="https://gillian850413.github.io//data/formula.png" style="width:470px" idyll="[object Object]"/><div class=""></div><div class=""></div></div></div></div></div>
