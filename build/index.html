They want to be wealthy and devote their abilities to make a better world. The Forbes’ billionaire list collects the top-ranking billionaires around the world. If you want to become a rich person, you may want to know how much you need to earn to achieve your dream. This raises some research questions:</p><ul><li>Which region has the highest possibility to become a billionaire?</li><li>If you were a normal citizen, what is the income gap between the billionaire and you?</li></ul><h2>Dataset Description</h2><p>This dataset collects the Forbes’ Billionaire list in 1996, 2001, and 2014, which includes information such as billionaire name, year company was founded, net worth in billions, and so on. It also includes the country GDP, region and industry for further comparisons. This project provides a preliminary analysis of the billionaire dataset and focuses on wealth distribution, wealth differences, GDP among billionaires and citizens in different regions. </p><h2>Number of Billionaires in each country</h2><p>Let’s start with looking at where the Forbes billionaires were located in the world. The stacked bar chart shows the billionaire distribution of each country in 1996, 2011 and 2014. Each color corresponds to one year of Forbe’s list. As you can see, the United States has the largest total number of billionaires, far greater than any of the rest of the countries. Yet, we don’t know what kind of net worth these American billionaires have. </p><div class=""></div><h2>Comparison of average worth in billions of individual billionaire among seven regions</h2><p>By grouping the countries into regions, each bar in the chart represents the aggregated net worth of each billionaire within each region in 1996, 2001, and 2014. From the plot, we can see that the average net worth is between 2 billion and 4 billion, and there is no vast difference among the regions in the currency unit of billions.</p><div class=""></div><h2>GDP and Proportion trend</h2><p>In order to obtain more insights regarding the billionaires and their regions, we make the barchart and discover the correlation between GDP and average net worth. The bar chart below shows us the GDP of seven regions in 1996, 2001 and 2014, while the scatterplots display the proportion of the numbers of billionaires held in the population. The charts demonstrate positive correlations between GDP trend and billionaire proportion trend in each of the seven regions, and strong relationships between GDP value and proportion value at any certain time.</p><div class=""></div><div class=""></div><h2>The gaps between the haves and have-nots</h2><p>Everyone knows there is a great gap between common people’s property and super wealthy’s, but how great is the gap exactly? More importantly, are the gaps equal in different countries and regions? If not, in which region the gap between super wealthy and common people is the smallest?</p><p>From the dataset we collected, we have the number of billionaires and their total amount of property in each country, along with the GDP value and population of these countries. We assume we can develop an indicator that can to some extent quantify the gap between the haves and have-nots based on these data. Here is the equation of our indicator:</p><img src="https://gillian850413.github.io//data/formula.png" style="width:470px" idyll="[object Object]"/><div class=""></div><div class=""></div><p>Wealth inequality is often observed and quantified as a certain percent of a country’s total wealth is possessed by a certain top percentage of people. We chose three iconic countries in South Asian, East Asian, and North America. Wealth differences are transformed into an interesting figure. Top 1% population of the red country has the income that is equivalent to the sum of 21 people who earn the average income of the whole population; the average income of the top 1% blue country’s population would equal to 8 people with average national income combined. Also, similarly you can see the monetary equivalence is demonstrated in numbers of people when comparing across nations.</p><img src="https://gillian850413.github.io/data/us_india.png" style="width:1000px;height:550px" idyll="[object Object]"/><p>Green: South Asian Country, Red: North American Country, Blue: East Asia</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If you want to be a billionaire, the U.S. will be the best place to stay to pursue that goal since it has the largest proportion of billionaires. Also given the innovative and rapidly developing nature of US industries, the US also has the highest wealth differences and the absolute highest net worth among billionaires. However, the largest wealth inequality doesn’t happen in North America, rather it’s the South Asian region where the Riches are super rich while the Poors are extremely poor.</p></section></div></div></div></div>
